# Flight-Price-Predictor

This project aims to predict the prices of domestic flights in India based on data scraped from EaseMyTrip.com between February 11, 2022, and March 31, 2022. Users can input the date of departure, date of arrival, starting location, ending location, number of stops, and preferred airlines to receive a prediction of the flight ticket price. 

The data was trained using a Random Forest Regressor model through Jupyter Notebooks. The dataset was split into testing and training data, analyzed on the training data, and the results were implemented on the testing data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- Flask
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Features

- **Flight Price Prediction**: Users can get an accurate prediction of flight ticket prices based on various input parameters.
- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Utilized libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyze and preprocess the data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built a prediction model using the Random Forest classification algorithm, achieving almost 85% accuracy in predicting costs.

## Additional Notes
This project was done as a group, therefore it is forked from another @mythrikulkarni github repo
