# Flight-Price-Predictor


This project attempts to predict the prices of domestic flights in India based on data scraped from EaseMyTrip.com from February 11, 2022 to March 31, 2022. Users can input date of departure, date of arrival, starting location, ending location, number of stops, and preferred airlines to recieve a prediction of the price of the flight ticket. Trained the data using Random Forest Regressor Model through Jupyter Notebooks. Split the data set into testing and training data and performed analysis on the training data and implemented results on the testing data.
